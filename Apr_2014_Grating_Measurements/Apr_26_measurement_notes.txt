Notes for Apr 26 grating measurements

Used takahashi beam expander setup. 

Align and null fringes with m2g3 mounted. Optimize interferometer settings - do not touch taka or interferometer again. 

Measure m2g3_0, m2g3_90, m2g3_180. m2g3_0 has serial number up. 90 and 180 are 90 and 180 degree rotations, in counterclockwise sense when looking at the grating surface. 

Next measure m1g4 without moving mount. 

Move mount to about zero defocus, remeasure m1g4. 

Measure m2g1.

Move mount back to original position, then measure m2g1. 

This day I also installed m2g3 into flight mount, then measured surface in mount.
